My first computer was the old [TK-85][tk-85]{:target="_blank"} (a Brazilian [ZX-81][zx-81]{:target="_blank"} clone). I've learned [BASIC][basic]{:target="_blank"} at the age of 13. I enjoyed it so much that I ended up graduating in Computer Science at [UFPE][ufpe]{:target="_blank"}. My first job was not usual. I was hired to develop embedded software and device drivers using [Assembly][assembly]{:target="_blank"} and [C][c]{:target="_blank"}. From there, I have migrated to other platforms and languages. Since 2017 I have been working in [Nubank][nubank]{:target="_blank"}, using [microservices architecture][microservices]{:target="_blank"} and [Clojure][clojure]{:target="_blank"}. Besides the work at Nubank, I'm also one of the [Podebug podcast][podebug]{:target="_blank"} hosts and write for this blog. My name is **Luiz Borba**.
